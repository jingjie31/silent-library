                            twentieth-century literature. The townspeople of
                            Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which
                            condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying

                            Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde,
                            appearing as the lead story in Lippincott's Monthly
                            Magazine on 20 June 1890, printed as the July 1890
                            issue. The magazine's editors feared the story was
                            indecent as submitted, so they
                            censored roughly 500 words, without Wilde's
                            knowledge, before publication. But even with that,
                            the story was still greeted with outrage by
                            British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde
                            should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde
                            to defend the novel
                            aggressively in letters to the British press. Today,
                            Wilde's fin de siècle novella is considered a
                            classic. This new edition from Immortal Books

                            is set in the sprawling flatlands of Florida, where
                            twenty-eight-year-old Miles is photographing
                            the last lingering traces of families who have
                            abandoned their houses due to debt or foreclosure.
                            Miles is haunted by guilt for having
                            inadvertently caused the death of his step-brother,
                            a situation that caused him to flee his father and
                            step-mother in New York seven years
                            ago. What keeps him in Florida is his relationship
                            with a teenage high-school girl, Pilar, but when her
                            family threatens to expose their
                            relationship, Miles decides to protect Pilar by
                            going back to Brooklyn, where he settles in a squat
                            to prepare himself to face the inevitable
                            confrontation with his father - a confrontation he
                            has been avoiding for years. Set against the
                            backdrop of the devastating global recession,
                            and pulsing with the energy of Auster's previous
                            novel Invisible, Sunset Park is as mythic as it is
                            contemporary, as in love with baseball as it is
                            with literature. It is above all, a story about love
                            and forgiveness - not only among men and women, but

                            young Frankie Presto, a war orphan raised by a blind
                            music teacher in a small Spanish town. At nine years
                            old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a
                            boat. His only possession is an old
                            guitar and six precious strings. But Frankie's
                            talent is touched by the gods, and his amazing
                            journey weaves him through the musical
                            landscape of the 20th century, from classical to

                            star himself. He makes records.
                            He is adored. But his gift is also his burden, as he
                            realizes, through his music, he can actually affect
                            people's futures -- with one string
                            turning blue whenever a life is altered. At the
                            height of his popularity, Frankie Presto vanishes.

                            some of Dickens's most
                            memorable characters. Among them are the kindly
                            blacksmith Joe Gargery, the mysterious convict Abel
                            Magwitch, the eccentric Miss
                            Haversham and her beautiful ward Estella, Pip's
                            good-hearted room-mate Herbert Pocket and the
                            pompous Pumblechook. As Pip unravels
                            the truth behind his own great expectations in his
                            quest to become a gentleman, the mysteries of the
                            past and the convolutions of fate
                            through a series of thrilling adventures serve to
                            steer him towards maturity and his most important
                            discovery of all - the truth about himself.

                            Translated by Willa and Edwin Muir The
                            Trial reflects the central spiritual crises of
                            modern life. Kafkaʼs method—one that has influenced,
                            in some way, almost every writer of
                            substance who followed him—was to render the absurd
                            and the terrifying convincing by a scrupulous,
                            hyperreal matter-of-factness of tone
                            and treatment. He thereby imparted to his work a
                            level of seriousness normally associated with
                            civilizationʼs most cherished poems and
                            religious texts. Everyman's Library pursues the

                            novel about a neglected human rights pioneer by the
                            Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa In 1916,
                            the Irish nationalist Roger Casement was hanged by
                            the British government for treason. Casement had
                            dedicated his extraordinary life to
                            improving the plight of oppressed peoples around the
                            world—especially the native populations in the
                            Belgian Congo and the Amazon—but
                            when he dared to draw a parallel between the
                            injustices he witnessed in African and American
                            colonies and those committed by the British in
                            Northern Ireland, he became involved in a cause that
                            led to his imprisonment and execution. Ultimately,
                            the scandals surrounding Casement's
                            trial and eventual hanging tainted his image to such
                            a degree that his pioneering human rights work
                            wasn't fully reexamined until the 1960s. In
                            The Dream of the Celt, Mario Vargas Llosa, who has
                            long been regarded as one of Latin America's most
                            vibrant, provocative, and necessary
                            literary voices—a fact confirmed when he was awarded
                            the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010—brings this
                            complex character to life as no other
                            writer can. A masterful work, sharply translated by
                            Edith Grossman, The Dream of the Celt tackles a
                            controversial man whose story has long
                            been neglected, and, in so doing, pushes at the
                            boundaries of the historical novel.
